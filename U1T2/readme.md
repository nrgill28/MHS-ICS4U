### 7. Stock Transaction Program
Last month Joe purchased some stock in Acme Software, Inc. Here are the details of the purchase:

- The number of shares that Joe purchased was 2,000.
- When Joe purchased the stock, he paid $40.00 per share.
- Joe paid his stockbroker a commission that amounted to 3 percent of the amount he paid for the stock.

Two weeks later Joe sold the stock. Here are the details of the sale:

- The number of shares that Joe sold was 2,000.
- He sold the stock for $42.75 per share.
- He paid his stockbroker another commission that amounted to 3 percent of the amount he received for the stock.

Write a program that displays the following information:
- The amount of money Joe paid for the stock.
- The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he bought the stock.
- The amount that Joe sold the stock for.
- The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he sold the stock.
- Display the amount of money that Joe had left when he sold the stock and paid his broker (both times). If this amount is positive, then Joe made a profit. If the amount is negative, then Joe lost money.
