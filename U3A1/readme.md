# U3A1 - Dictionary Assignment

### Overview
Link Crew is a high school transition program that welcomes freshmen and makes them feel comfortable throughout the first year of their high school experience. Built on the belief that students can help students succeed, Boomerang Projectâ€™s proven high school transition program trains mentors from your junior and senior classes to be Link Crew Leaders. As positive role models, Link Crew Leaders are mentors and student leaders who guide the freshmen to discover what it takes to be successful during the transition to high school and help facilitate freshman success.
In this assignment, you will create a program that allows link crew leaders to track the schedules for each student in their group.

### In this program, the user will be able to:
- Add students to the database
- Delete students from the database
- Add details to the schedule (ie. what classes they are taking each period). 
- View student schedules
- Edit student schedules

Your program must use nested dictionaries where the main key is the student name.
