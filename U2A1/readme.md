# U2A1 - Theater Reservation Program

### Overview
The ByTowne Cinema is a theatre located on Rideau Street. It was established in 1947 and is one of Ottawa’s oldest theatres. It has seen many changes over the year and the owners have decided to up their game and implement a digital booking system. This system will allow users to book their seat for a movie so that they do not have to fight the crowds when a movie hits the theater. They have hired our company, ICS4U Interactive Media, to create their system.

The theatre only has one screen and, therefore, can only show one movie at a time

### Information
Your system must allow the user to purchase a seat for the movie show below:
Movie Title: Jojo Rabbit
Dates Showing: March 2nd at 6:55pm, March 3rd at 9:00pm
Price per Ticket: $12.00 for Non-Members, $8.00 for ByTowne Members (with card), $6.00 for Children under 12

The user will be allowed to choose the seat that they wish to sit in. The theatre has 5 rows with 7 seats each (5 x 7) and you cannot purchase a seat that has already been sold. 
In reality there are 640 seats, but we’ll scale it down)

Finally, we don't need no GUIs! Implement a Python script called yourname_movieSystem.py for the program listed above.

### Extensions
Should you finish early, feel free to add additional functionality to the program in order to achieve the level 4++ criteria. Be sure to note in your comments what you have added to the program. Some options include:
