# U5T2 - Inheritance Intro
## 1: Employee and ProductionWorker Classes
Write an Employee class that keeps data attributes for the following pieces of information:
• Employee name
• Employee number

Next, write a class named ProductionWorker that is a subclass of the Employee class. The
ProductionWorker class should keep data attributes for the following information:
• Shift number (an integer, such as 1, 2, or 3)
• Hourly pay rate

The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. The shift attribute will hold an
integer value representing the shift that the employee works. The day shift is shift 1 and the
night shift is shift 2. Write the appropriate accessor and mutator methods for each class.
Once you have written the classes, write a program that creates an object of the
ProductionWorker class and prompts the user to enter data for each of the object’s data
attributes. Store the data in the object and then use the object’s accessor methods to retrieve
it and display it on the screen.

## 2: ShiftSupervisor Class
In a particular factory, a shift supervisor is a salaried employee who supervises a shift. In
addition to a salary, the shift supervisor earns a yearly bonus when his or her shift meets
production goals. Write a ShiftSupervisor class that is a subclass of the Employee class
you created in Programming Exercise 1. The ShiftSupervisor class should keep a data
attribute for the annual salary and a data attribute for the annual production bonus that
a shift supervisor has earned. Demonstrate the class by writing a program that uses a
ShiftSupervisor object.

## 3: Person and Customer Classes
Write a class named Person with data attributes for a person’s name, address, and telephone
number. Next, write a class named Customer that is a subclass of the Person class.
The Customer class should have a data attribute for a customer number and a Boolean
data attribute indicating whether the customer wishes to be on a mailing list. Demonstrate
an instance of the Customer class in a simple program.
